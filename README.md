# SkillSync

SkillSync helps you find relevant jobs, tailor your resume, and apply with AI assistance while you stay in control.

## Install (First)

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

2. From the project root run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. Open:
- App: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend health: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### Option 2: Run locally (without Docker)

#### Frontend

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Visible browser setup (required for browser-assisted features)

Start Chrome with remote debugging before using AI Auto Search or AI Assisted Apply.

### macOS

```bash
open -na "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --user-data-dir=/tmp/career-copilot-cdp
```

### Windows

```bat
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --user-data-dir=%TEMP%\career-copilot-cdp
```

If `chrome.exe` is not in PATH:

```bat
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --user-data-dir=%TEMP%\career-copilot-cdp
```

Verify endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9222/json/version
```

## Quick troubleshooting

- App not loading: make sure frontend is on `:3000` and backend on `:8000`.
- Browser features not working: check Chrome debug endpoint above.
- AI output weak or unavailable: confirm your backend AI API key is configured.

## Small technical overview

Career Co-Pilot is a local-first monorepo:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **Automation**: Playwright (browser-assisted flows)
- **Data**: SQLite (local storage)
- **AI**: Gemini-powered generation and guidance

Design goal: user-controlled automation, not blind one-click mass applying.
